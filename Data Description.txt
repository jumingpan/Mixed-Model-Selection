The data is from the Amsterdam Growth and Health Study (Kemper, 1995), which
examines the relationship between lifestyle and health in adolescence and young
adulthood. 

The first column is the subject id. The second column is the
continuous response variable Y of our interest, which is the total serum cholesterol
expressed in mmoll. 

The columns 3-6 are four predictors X1 (fitness level at
baseline measured as maximal oxygen uptake on a treadmill, the third column),
X2 (body fat estimated by the sum of the thickness of four skinfolds, the fourth
column), X3 (smoking behavior dichotomized as smoking versus non-smoking, 0
= no; 1 =yes, the fifth column), and X4 (gender, 1 = male; 2= female, the six
column). All variables were measured at n = 6 time occasions, which is coded
from 1 to 6. The time of measurement is taken as an additional predictor (X5, the
seventh column). The columns 8 and 9 are other available dichotomous and
categorical response variables. For this project, we ignore these two columns.

Here a total of m = 147 subjects participated in the study, and the overall sample
size is N = 1476 = 882.
